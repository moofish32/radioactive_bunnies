# Radioactive Bunnies

This is a fork off the excellent baseline library frenzy_bunnies provided by
@jondot. Our intent is to use this as the underlying library for a new service
framework enabling lightweight ruby microservices. The following has been
changed to support this:

- Worker#work receives both metadata and payload, straight from march_hare

- Workers & Contexts support selecting their exchange via a nested hash of opts

- Tests have been moved to rspec and are all IT (requiring a rabbitmq server)

- Context is aware of all worker descendants via an included hook

More changes to come, including cleaning up the rest of the README.

## Original Introduction

A lightweight background workers library based on JRuby and the very efficient `march_hare` RabbitMQ driver for very fast and
efficient processing.

Unlike other background job processing libraries, a Frenzy Bunnies worker is offering its work to a native JVM-based thread pool, where threads are allocated and cached.  

This firstly means that the processing model isn't process-per-worker (saving memory) and it also isn't fixed-thread-per-worker based allowing workers to be pooled(saving memory even further).

RabbitMQ is a really awesome queue solution for background jobs as well as more real-time messaging processing. Within its strengths are its [performance](http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2012/04/17/rabbitmq-performance-measurements-part-1/), portability - [almost every worthy server-side language and platform](http://www.rabbitmq.com/devtools.html) has a RabbitMQ driver and you're not limited to process on a single platform, and high-availability out of the box (as opposed to Redis, although [Sentinel](http://redis.io/topics/sentinel-spec) is quite a progress - hurray!).  


Here are [great background slides](https://speakerdeck.com/u/hungryblank/p/rails-underground-2009-rabbitmq)  given by Paolo Negri over Rails Underground 2009 about [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/).

## Quick Start

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'frenzy_bunnies'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install frenzy_bunnies

Then, you basically just need to define a worker in its own class, and then
decide if you want to use the Frenzy Bunnies runner
`frenzy_bunnies` to run it, or do it programmatically via the
`FrenzyBunnies::Context` API.

```ruby
class FeedWorker
  include FrenzyBunnies::Worker
  from_queue 'new.feeds', :prefetch => 20, :threads => 13, :durable => true

  def work(msg)
    puts msg
    ack!
  end
end
```

You indicate that a class is a worker by `include
FrenzyBunnies::Worker`. Set up a queue with `from_queue` and implement a
`work(msg)` method. 

You should indicate successful processing with
`ack!`, otherwise it will be rejected and lost (per RabbitMQ semantics,
in future versions, they'll add a feature where rejected messages goes
to an error queue).

### Running with CLI

Running a worker with the command-line executable is easy

    $ frenzy_bunnies start_workers worker_file.rb

Where `worker_file.rb` is a file containing all of your worker(s)
definition. FrenzyBunnies will require the file and immediately start
handing work to your workers.

### Running Programatically

Assuming that workers are already `require`d in your code, their classes
should be visible by the moment you write this code:

```ruby
f = FrenzyBunnies::Context.new
f.run FeedWorker, FeedDownloader
```

In the listing above, `f.run` accepts your worker _classes_, and will run your workers immediately.


## Web Dashboard

When FrenzyBunnies run, it will automatically create a web dashboard for you, on `localhost:11333` by default.


Currently, the dashboard displays your job statistics (passed vs. failed), JVM
health (heap usage) and threads overview.

Changing the bound address is easy to do through the many options you can pass to the running `Context`:

```ruby
f = FrenzyBunnies::Context.new :web_host=>'0.0.0.0', :web_port=>11222
```


context definitions

## In Detail

### Worker Configuration

In your worker class, say `from_queue 'queue_name'` and pass any of these options:

```ruby
:exchange # default frenzy_bunnies. name of exchange.
:exchange_type # default :direct. type of exchange used.
:routing_key # default queue_name. allows for other routing keys, useful for topic exchanges.
:prefetch  # default 10. number of messages to prefetch each time
:durable   # default false. durability of the queue
:timeout_job_after # default 5. reject the message if not processed for number of seconds
:threads  # default none. number of threads in the threadpool. leave empty to let the threadpool manage it.
```

Example:


```ruby
class FeedWorker
  include FrenzyBunnies::Worker
  from_queue 'new.feeds', :prefetch => 20, :threads => 13, :durable => true

...  
```

### General Configuration

Global / running configuration can be set through the running context `FrenzyBunnies::Context`, pass any of these as options (shown with defaults).

```ruby
:host       # default 'localhost'
:heartbeat  # default 5
:web_host   # default 'localhost'
:web_port   # default 11333
:web_threadfilter # default /^pool-.*/
:env        # default ''
```


Example:

```ruby
FrenzyBunnies::Context.new :heartbeat => 10
```

### AMQP Queue Wiring Under the Hood

If you're interested with the mechanics, in order to mimic a background-job / work-queue 
semantics, the following is the AMQP wireup used within this library:

* Durable per configuration
* The exchange is created and named by default `frenzy_bunnies`
* Each worker is bound to an AMQP queue named `my_queue_environment` with the environment postfix appended automatically.
* The routing key on the exchange is of the same name and bound to the queue.
